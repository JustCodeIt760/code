## MVP Features Scope

### Must Have
- User authentication (login/signup)
- Project creation and management
- Basic task management
- Simple AI task generation
- Basic timeline visualization
- Task dependencies
- Real-time updates

### Not Included in MVP
- Team management
- Complex permissions
- Advanced AI features
- Multiple project views
- Custom fields
- Advanced reporting
- Integration with external tools

## Technical Constraints
- Use SQLite for MVP (simpler than PostgreSQL setup)
- Basic JWT authentication (no OAuth)
- Simple AI prompts (no complex chains)
- Basic WebSocket implementation
- Minimal styling (focus on functionality)
- Limited error handling
- Basic form validation

## Success Criteria
1. Users can create projects and tasks
2. AI can generate basic task suggestions
3. Tasks can be visualized on a timeline
4. Basic dependencies can be created
5. Changes are persisted to database
6. UI is functional (not necessarily polished)
7. Core features work reliably

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with simple AI integration
- Use proven libraries for timeline visualization
- Keep authentication simple
- Focus on core functionality
- Minimize external dependencies
- Regular commits and backups
- Test critical paths frequently

## Definition of Done
- Feature is implemented
- Basic tests are written
- Code is committed
- Feature is functional
- Basic documentation exists
- No critical bugs
- Runs in development environment

## Next Sprint Preview
1. Advanced AI features
2. Team management
3. Better UI/UX
4. More sophisticated timeline features
5. Additional project views
6. Enhanced error handling
7. Production deployment

# Project Timeline Optimization

## Overview

This project will enable dynamic project timeline adjustments by allowing drag-and-drop of features into a sprint. Each sprint will incorporate all features and their associated tasks into a Gantt chart. Multiple team members will be assigned to a project, sprint, and task.

AI will generate tasks and optimize the timeline contextually for the project, phase, and sprint using an R1 Chain of Thought approach:

1. Project-level Analysis – Evaluating overall project details
2. Phase-level Analysis – Considering the current phase and data from previous phases
3. Sprint-level Analysis – Assessing the features included in the current sprint
4. Task Generation – Creating a graph structure for tasks, similar to the Git graph in VS Code, allowing multiple assignments and dependencies

The chatbot will handle all project interactions and task assignments by invoking relevant API endpoints. Users will confirm changes manually to avoid ambiguity. Buttons will be available to add text to the chatbot interface, reducing confusion.

## Organizations and Team Management

### Organizations
- Each project belongs to an Organization, which serves as a container for multiple projects
- Organizations have owners, admins, and members, each with different permissions
- An organization can manage multiple teams, each assigned to specific projects or tasks
- Users can be part of multiple organizations, with role-based access control (RBAC)
- Organization-wide settings include API access, billing, and default security configurations

### Team Members and Roles
- Organization Owner – Full administrative access, including user management and billing

You're covering a lot, but let's take a deeper dive into the **AI Agents** and **workflow orchestration** for the **R1 Chain of Thought** approach. Here's how you can structure the AI implementation effectively:

---

# **AI Agent Architecture for Project Timeline Optimization**

To dynamically optimize project timelines and generate tasks, AI agents need structured reasoning, contextual memory, and interaction with your database. We'll use an **R1 Chain of Thought (CoT)** approach with multiple specialized agents:

### **1. Agent-Oriented Architecture**
Each agent has a **distinct function** and communicates via an event-driven system, backed by **Redis (pub/sub), Celery, or an event broker (e.g., NATS, Kafka).** Agents will operate asynchronously to **avoid blocking the main application**.

### **2. Core AI Agents**
| **Agent Name** | **Function** |
|--------------|------------|
| **Project Analyzer Agent** | Assesses project scope, constraints, and historical data |
| **Phase Evaluator Agent** | Determines tasks based on phase dependencies and progress |
| **Sprint Optimizer Agent** | Assigns tasks, balances workloads, optimizes sprints |
| **Task Generator Agent** | Generates granular tasks in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) |
| **Dependency Resolver Agent** | Identifies dependencies between tasks (like Git graphs) |
| **Chatbot Interaction Agent** | Handles user queries and updates project states |
| **Notification & Feedback Agent** | Provides real-time updates and suggestions |

Each agent is a **stateful process**, either running as a separate service (microservices) or invoked via Celery tasks.

---

# **Building These Agents: Implementation Plan**

## **1. Project Analyzer Agent**
### **Purpose**
- Reads the **Project Charter**, **business case**, and **current progress**
- Identifies **goals**, **time constraints**, and **team availability**
- Classifies the **type of project** and recommends **best methodologies** (Agile, Waterfall, etc.)

### **Implementation**
- **LLM-based reasoning (OpenAI, Gemini, or local models like Llama3)**
- Uses **vector database (Weaviate, ChromaDB, or Redis AI)** to store past projects
- Implements **graph-based analysis** to compare against previous similar projects

---

## **2. Phase Evaluator Agent**
### **Purpose**
- Assesses the **current phase** (Planning, Coding, Testing, etc.)
- Predicts **bottlenecks** by looking at previous phases
- Determines the **next best actions** based on historical data

### **Implementation**
- Uses a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** to determine likely phase outcomes
- Stores past **project phase results** in a **time-series database (TimescaleDB)**
- Uses **prompt chaining** to guide AI reasoning step-by-step

---

## **3. Sprint Optimizer Agent**
### **Purpose**
- Distributes workload **evenly across team members**
- Balances **complexity vs. urgency**
- Uses **reinforcement learning (RL)** to improve sprint planning over time

### **Implementation**
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration (e.g., RLHF)**
- Uses **Bayesian Optimization** to predict optimal task order
- Considers:
  - Team member skillset (stored in a **skills matrix**)
  - Dependencies & priorities
  - Project deadlines

---

## **4. Task Generator Agent**
### **Purpose**
- Generates tasks **step-by-step** from project goals
- Builds a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** for task dependencies
- Ensures tasks are **not redundant**

### **Implementation**
- **GPT-4-turbo or local model (Llama3) fine-tuned for project management**
- Uses **graph-based planning** (e.g., NetworkX for Python)
- Queries the **project's database** for past similar tasks

**Example Task Structure:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "12345",
  "name": "Implement API Authentication",
  "dependencies": ["Setup Database", "Define User Model"],
  "assigned_to": ["Dev1", "Dev2"],
  "priority": "high",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

---

## **5. Dependency Resolver Agent**
### **Purpose**
- Identifies **task dependencies automatically**
- Uses **Git-like graphs** to visualize relationships
- Prevents **deadlocks** where a task cannot proceed

### **Implementation**
- **Graph Algorithms (Topological Sorting, Shortest Path)**
- Uses **DAG Structure (Directed Acyclic Graph)**
- If a **cyclic dependency** is detected, it recommends alternative ordering

**Example DAG Representation in Code (Python/NetworkX):**
```python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_edges_from([
    ("Setup Database", "Define User Model"),
    ("Define User Model", "Implement API Authentication"),
    ("Implement API Authentication", "Frontend Integration"),
])

nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
```

---

- Integrates with **Slack, Discord, and Web UI**

### **Implementation**
- Uses **LLM-powered chatbot (OpenAI GPT, Claude, Gemini)**
- Supports **Markdown-based updates**
- Implements **vector search** for historical project queries

---

## **7. Notification & Feedback Agent**
### **Purpose**
- Sends **real-time updates** when a task is modified
- Uses **Reinforcement Learning (RL) for prioritization**
- Collects feedback on **task effectiveness**

### **Implementation**
- WebSockets for **real-time alerts**
- Sentiment Analysis on user feedback
- **Event-driven triggers** using Redis Pub/Sub

---

  scalable_target_action {
    min_capacity = 0 # Stop service
    max_capacity = 0
  }
}

resource "aws_appautoscaling_scheduled_action" "ecs_start_morning" {
  name               = "ecs-start-in-morning"
  service_namespace  = "ecs"
  resource_id        = aws_appautoscaling_target.ecs_target.resource_id
